                            I am a dedicated developer, specializing in frontend development, who loves coding and problem-solving. I find immense joy in creating software, more than in anything else. So, why did I suddenly find the audacity to do the unthinkableâ€”learn design? I mean, come on, we all know developers can't learn design. Or can they? And should they? Perhaps adding frontend skills to my repertoire isn't such a crazy idea after all.
